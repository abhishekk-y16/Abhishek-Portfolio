  <h2 style="color: white;">Professional Experience</h2>
  <p>
    Throughout my journey, I have consistently demonstrated exceptional leadership by successfully guiding teams through high-stakes hackathons. These experiences, often under intense time constraints and high pressure, have refined my ability to blend technical execution with strategic vision. I thrive in transforming abstract ideas into tangible solutions by aligning my team’s strengths and fostering collaboration across all stages of project development.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a team leader, I prioritize empowering every member, ensuring that they are not only motivated but also actively involved in shaping the direction of our work. My approach is based on clarity of purpose, adaptability to changing environments, and an unwavering commitment to excellence. 
  </p>
  <p>
    These experiences have shaped me into a resilient engineer and a decisive collaborator—someone who thrives under pressure and views challenges as opportunities for growth. I believe leadership is not just about guiding others but continuously evolving as a team and an individual. Every project I lead reflects this ethos, and I strive to inspire others while pushing the boundaries of what we can achieve together.
